# Employment and Education

## 2018-2020 | Senior Computational Biologist | 10x Genomics
Wrote software to help unravel biology and human health. Developer for the single cell ATAC product (<code>cellranger-atac</code>) and the Visium/Spatial Transcriptomics product (<code>spaceranger</code>), implemented in Python and Rust. 

## 2015-2018 | Bioinformatician | Epinomics
Implemented, trained, tested and deployed machine learning models to decode the programming of our genome -- the epigenome -- to drive personalized medicine, impact drug development and discover leads into clinical applications. Company was acquired by 10x Genomics.

## 2012-2015 | Postdoc in the group of Chirstina S. Leslie | Computational Biology Program | MSKCC

- Enhancer dynamics: Integrative analysis of enhancer landscape and gene expression dynamics in hematopoietic differentiation using DNase-seq, histone mark ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. Using a model that learns chromatin to predict gene expression, we showed how early establishment of enhancers and regulatory locus complexity together govern gene expression changes at cell state transitions.
- Immunology: Using inducible genetic tracing, we analyzed the long-term stability of activation-induced transcriptional, epigenomic, and functional changes in regulatory T cells (Tregs). We found that the inflammation-experienced Treg cell population reversed many activation-induced changes and lost its enhanced suppressive function over time. ‘‘Memory-less’’ Tregs may help avoid a state of generalized immunosuppression. In collaboration with Alexander Rudensky (MSKCC).
- Small RNAs: We show that in vivo, many expressed microRNAs exist in an inactive reserve, not stably associated with target mRNA. External signaling can promote the recruitment of these inactive microRNAs to large mRNA-containing complexes, in which their ability to repress targets is increased. In collaboration with Tom Tuschl (Rockefeller), Craig Thompson, and Andrea Ventura (MSKCC).
- Small RNAs: Study of polycistronic microRNA clusters. A large scale RNA-seq analysis of wild type and mutant embryos that were genetically engineered to harbor targeted deletions of individual components of the miR-17~92 cluster. We show how functional cooperation between members of the microRNA cluster affects gene expression programs in vivo. In collaboration with Andrea Ventura (MSKCC).
- Pharmacogenomics: Using drug response data for cancer cell lines, e.g. CCLE, we developed a multi-task learning strategy to predict drug sensitivity by jointly learning across many drugs. On held-out data, our joint training not only outperforms models that predict response individually for each drug, but also produces more interpretable results that lead to potential drug repurposing targets.

## 2006-2012 | Ph.D. in Computer Science | University of Delaware

- GPA: 3.95.

- Worked with Professors Li Liao and Cathy H. Wu on machine learning applications for proteomics. In my dissertation I studied and designed statistical learning techniques (e.g. hidden Markov models, support vector machines, the Fisher score, feature selection, kernel canonical correlation analysis) for prediction of protein-protein interactions, their binding residues and the functional and binding sites in both protein-ligand and enzyme-substrate complexes.

- Worked with Professor Blake C. Meyers developing database systems and web interfaces for storage, analysis and visualization of whole genome Small RNA and DNA methylation sequencing data from plant genomes (primarily legumes).

## 2004-2006 | Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering | University of Delaware

- GPA: 3.77.

- Focus on statistical image and signal processing. In my master's thesis I designed and implemented models for the human visual system based on the probability functions of alpha stable random variables. These models were shown to be useful in digital halftoning (the process of turning a continuous toned image into binary space for printing) over rectangular and hexagonal sampling grids.

## 1999-2003 | Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering | Pontificia Universidad Javeriana

- GPA: 3.40.

- Senior year project was an application of array processing and spectral estimation techniques for calculating the angle of arrival of a mobile source with respect to the normal of a linear array of receptors.
